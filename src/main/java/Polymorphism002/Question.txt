What is Polymorphism002?
    Polymorphism002 in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
    Polymorphism002 is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and
    "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

    There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and
    runtime polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading
    and method overriding.

    If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism.
    Here, we will focus on runtime polymorphism in java.

What is Method Overriding in Java?
    If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class,
    it is known as method overriding in Java.
    Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism
        1. The method must have the same name as in the parent class
        2. The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
        3. There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).

        while overriding a method of the super class we need to make sure that both
        methods have same name, same parameters and,
        same return type else they both will be treated as different methods.

What is Method Overloading in Java?
    If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters,
    it is known as Method Overloading.
    Method overloading is used for compile time polymorphism
    Different ways to overload the method
        1. By changing number of arguments
        2. By changing the data type
