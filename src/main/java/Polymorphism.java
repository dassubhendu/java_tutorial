/**
 * Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
 * There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.
 * We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
 * If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism.
 * Here, we will focus on runtime polymorphism in java.
