What is Polymorphism002?
    Polymorphism002 in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
    Polymorphism002 is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and
    "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

    There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and
    runtime polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading
    and method overriding.

    If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism.
    Here, we will focus on runtime polymorphism in java.
